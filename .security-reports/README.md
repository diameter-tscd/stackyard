# Security Reports

This folder contains automated security scan reports generated by the GitHub Actions workflow.

## Overview

Security scans are automatically triggered on:
- **Scheduled**: Daily at 2:00 AM UTC
- **Push**: To `main` or `development` branches
- **Pull Request**: Targeting `main` or `development` branches
- **Manual**: Via workflow dispatch

## Security Tools Used

| Tool | Description | Output Format |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| **Gosec** | Go security checker for common vulnerabilities | SARIF |
| **Nancy** | Dependency vulnerability scanner (Sonatype) | JSON |
| **Govulncheck** | Official Go vulnerability database checker | Text |
| **Trivy** | Comprehensive vulnerability scanner for dependencies | SARIF |
| **StaticCheck** | Advanced Go linter and bug detector | Console |
| **Go-Critic** | Go source code linter with extended checks | Console |
| **Gitleaks** | Secret and credential leak detection | Console |

## Report File Naming Convention

Reports follow this naming pattern:

```
scan_[STATUS]_[TIMESTAMP]_[EPOCH].md
gosec_[TIMESTAMP].sarif
trivy_[TIMESTAMP].sarif
```

- **STATUS**: `success` (no critical issues) or `alert` (critical/high issues found)
- **TIMESTAMP**: Format `YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS`
- **EPOCH**: Unix timestamp for cleanup scheduling

## Report Structure

Each consolidated markdown report contains:

1. **Header Information**
   - Scan date and time
   - Overall status
   - Epoch timestamp

2. **Govulncheck Results**
   - Known vulnerabilities in Go standard library and dependencies

3. **Nancy Results**
   - Dependency vulnerability analysis in JSON format

4. **Gosec Results**
   - Reference to SARIF file for detailed findings

## Report Retention Policy

- Reports older than **15 days** are automatically deleted
- Cleanup runs after each security scan
- Related SARIF files are removed along with their markdown reports

## Interpreting Results

### Status Indicators

- **success**: No CRITICAL or HIGH severity issues detected
- **alert**: CRITICAL or HIGH severity issues found - immediate review recommended

### Severity Levels

| Level | Action Required |
|-------|-----------------|
| CRITICAL | Immediate fix required |
| HIGH | Fix in current sprint |
| MEDIUM | Plan for future fix |
| LOW | Fix as time permits |

## Manual Review

To trigger a manual security scan:

1. Navigate to **Actions** tab in GitHub
2. Select **Go Security Scan** workflow
3. Click **Run workflow**
4. Select the target branch
5. Click **Run workflow** button

## Integration with GitHub Security

SARIF files are automatically uploaded to GitHub Security tab, enabling:

- Security alerts in pull requests
- Centralized vulnerability tracking
- Code scanning alerts dashboard
